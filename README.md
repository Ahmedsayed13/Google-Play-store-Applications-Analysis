# Google-Play-store-Applications-Analysis
I got data from kaggle about the applications of google play store, and there was a task to find the most popular applications by category, I assessed the data for the quality and tidiness issues in it then i cleaned it from all the issues that were in it, and then i shared some insights from it like:
1) Top 10 rated apps 
2) Top 10 categories
3) Top 10 Installed Apps on google play store
I shared these insights through simple horizontal bar charts to make it easy to be noticed and understood
