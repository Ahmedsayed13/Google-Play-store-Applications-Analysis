# Google-Play-store-Applications-Analysis
I got data from kaggle about the applications at google play store, and there was a task to find the most popular applications by category, After getting the csv file i did the following:
-Assessed the data for the quality and tidiness issues in it 
-Cleaned it from all the issues that were in it to make it ready to be analyzed.
And then i shared the required insights from it like:
1) Top 10 rated apps 
2) Top 10 categories
3) Top 10 Installed Apps on google play store
I shared these insights through simple horizontal bar charts to make it easy to be noticed and understood.
In brief i took the raw data, just rows and columns and transformed it into useful information in a simple neat way.
